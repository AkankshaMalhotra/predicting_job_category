* Go to directory in which code is stored in terminal
* The program can be run by typing on terminal python ./finalas.py
* Please enter the whole path to the training data
* In finalas.py, testing and training data is made by random distribution 

I have tested this program on corpus having 3471 and 6 job categories
This gave me accuracy of 94.5%


I have done many version for the same method, experimenting with divison of testing and training data, various data types and how to handle TermDocumentMatrix

One more version of program I have attached in which I have used different method for storing TermDocumentMatrix and method of division of testing data and training data is different.
* Go to directory in which code is stored in terminal
* The program can be run by typing on terminal python ./naive.py
* Please enter the whole path to the training data
* In naive.py, testing and training data is made by simply slicing data in the proportion 2/3 and 1/3


I have tested this program on corpus having 3471 and 6 job categories
This gave me accuracy of 95.08%
